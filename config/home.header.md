# Welcome to my Catalog of Projects
This site contains examples of some of my larger software projects. I am mainly a React web developer, but touch on back end development and React Native on occasion. Please enjoy browsing the summaries of my projects.

##About Me
I am a full time student at The Queensland University of Technology, studying a dual degree of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (Honours). I am also part of the QUT Motorsport team, helping develop the QEV Electric race car. 
I have been developing software for a number of years, in highschool writing control code for our team's First Tech Challenge Robot, with which we placed first at the Regional and National level competition and attended the international finals in St Louise, USA.
